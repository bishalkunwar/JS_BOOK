// Math is an inbuilt object that has attributes and methods for mathematical functions and constants. It’s not a function object. 
// Math object works with the Number type. The Math object does not have a constructor. All properties and methods of Math are fixed/static. The cosine function is known as Math.cos(y) while the constant pi is known as Math.PI, where y is the method’s argument. All the properties and methods of Math are static and can be called by using Math as an object without creating it.
