// JavaScript Operator: JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to compute the value or in other words, we can perform operations on operands. Arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, / ) are used to compute the value, and Assignment operators ( =, +=, %= ) are used to assign the values to variables.

// Variable Declaration and value assaignment

let num1 = 2; num2 = 6;

// Arithmetic operator to add two numbers
let sum = num1+num2;

console.log(`The sum of num1 and num2 is ${sum}`)

// JavaScript Expression: Expression is the combination of values, operators, and variables. It is used to compute the values.
let product = num1*sum;
let sub = product - sum

console.log("Just an example of JS Expression ");
console.log(` The product is: ${product} and the difference is: ${sub}`);
